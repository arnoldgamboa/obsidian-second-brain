## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Pastors and ministry leaders face significant "prompt fatigue" when using general-purpose AI tools for sermon preparation and church communication. Existing AI chat interfaces require users to manually carry context across sessions, lack theological depth, and force pastors to act as both prompt engineer and theologian. This creates friction, produces shallow outputs, and wastes hours each week that could be spent on pastoral care.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution
YouPastor is a Desktop-first AI Workspace that transforms raw AI capabilities into guided, task-oriented workflows tailored for faith-based leaders. It acts as a Theological Research Assistant that maintains context across a pastor's entire weekly output — from sermon brainstorming to social media scheduling — through an agentic loop with human-in-the-loop approvals.

### 1.3 Goals
- Reduce sermon preparation time by 40% while improving theological depth and accuracy
- Eliminate context loss when transitioning between sermon prep, communication, and repurposing tasks
- Enable non-technical pastors to leverage advanced AI capabilities without learning prompt engineering
- Build a sustainable SaaS business with metered, credit-based billing
- Establish a foundation for denominational and stylistic customization (theological guardrails)

### 1.4 Non-Goals
- Mobile app or mobile-responsive design for MVP (desktop-first only)
- Voice-to-Text input or PDF processing in MVP (deferred to Phase 2)
- Real-time collaboration or multi-user editing in MVP
- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning in MVP
- Integration with church management software (ChMS) APIs in MVP

---

## 2. Background & Context

### 2.1 Business Context
The faith-based technology market is underserved by AI tools. While pastors increasingly adopt AI for sermon writing, they rely on generic tools (ChatGPT, Claude) that lack theological nuance, biblical languages support, and church-specific workflows. There is a strategic opportunity to own the "AI workspace for pastors" category before established players enter the niche. Solo founder context requires a lean, text-first MVP that can validate product-market fit quickly.

### 2.2 User Research / Insights
Assumptions based on founder domain expertise and observed pastoral workflows:
- Pastors spend 10–20 hours per week on sermon preparation and communication
- Most pastors are not technical and find prompt engineering intimidating
- Context switching between sermon prep, announcements, and social media is a major pain point
- Theological accuracy and denominational alignment are non-negotiable
- Budget constraints are common in smaller churches; transparent, usage-based pricing is preferred over flat subscriptions

### 2.3 Dependencies & Related Work
- OpenRouter API access and rate limits
- Convex cloud deployment and workflow limits
- Electron desktop distribution pipeline (codesigning, auto-updates)
- Stripe billing integration for credit-based metering
- Future integration with existing pastoral tools (Bible software, planning center, etc.)

## 3. Users & Use Cases

### 3.1 Target Users

**Primary Persona: Pastor Alex**
- Role: Lead pastor of a 200-member church
- Technical proficiency: Low-medium; uses email, social media, basic apps
- Goals: Prepare theologically rich sermons faster; communicate consistently with congregation
- Frustrations: AI tools produce generic content; loses context between tasks; doesn't understand church calendar rhythms

**Secondary Persona: Worship Leader Jordan**
- Role: Worship pastor who also writes devotionals and social content
- Technical proficiency: Medium; comfortable with productivity apps
- Goals: Repurpose Sunday content into midweek devotionals and social posts
- Frustrations: Creating content from scratch each week; maintaining voice consistency

**Tertiary Persona: Church Admin Taylor**
- Role: Administrative assistant who drafts emails and announcements
- Technical proficiency: Medium-high
- Goals: Quickly draft church communications aligned with the pastor's sermon themes
- Frustrations: Waiting for pastor input; starting emails from blank pages

### 3.2 User Stories

- As a pastor, I want to enter a sermon topic or scripture reference and receive guided brainstorming options so that I can find a compelling angle without staring at a blank page.
- As a pastor, I want the AI to perform Greek and Hebrew word studies automatically so that I can deepen my exegesis without knowing the original languages.
- As a pastor, I want to approve or redirect the AI's research direction at key decision points so that the output remains aligned with my theological framework and congregation's needs.
- As a worship leader, I want to convert a completed sermon into a small group discussion guide so that I can extend the Sunday message into midweek ministry.
- As a church admin, I want to draft a church announcement email that references this week's sermon theme so that our communications feel cohesive and intentional.
- As a pastor, I want to generate a 7-day social media calendar based on my sermon so that I can maintain a consistent online presence without starting from scratch each day.

### 3.3 Key User Flows

**Primary Flow: Sermon Preparation**
1. Pastor opens YouPastor and selects the "Sermon Prep" workspace
2. Pastor enters a scripture reference or topical seed
3. Agent loads relevant theological skills (Greek/Hebrew tools, commentary access, outline frameworks)
4. Agent presents 2–3 sermon hook/angle options and pauses for pastor selection
5. Pastor selects an angle or provides feedback
6. Agent conducts exegesis, generates outline, and presents for approval
7. Pastor approves or requests revisions
8. Completed sermon is saved and becomes available to other workspaces

**Secondary Flow: Communication Drafting**
1. Pastor or admin opens "Communication" workspace
2. System auto-loads the current week's sermon context
3. User selects communication type (email, announcement script, formal letter)
4. Agent drafts content using sermon themes and tone preferences
5. User edits and approves; draft is saved or exported

**Edge Flow: Offline Access**
1. Pastor opens YouPastor without internet connection
2. IndexedDB serves cached sermon drafts and last-known workspace state
3. Pastor can read and edit existing content
4. Upon reconnection, Convex syncs changes and resumes any pending agent workflows

**Edge Flow: Credit Exhaustion**
1. Pastor initiates a high-cost task (e.g., full exegetical deep-dive)
2. System checks credit balance
3. If insufficient credits, system displays a clear upgrade/purchase prompt
4. Pastor can purchase additional credits or switch to a lower-cost task

---

## 6. UX & Design Considerations

### 6.1 Design Principles
- **Minimize friction:** Every AI interaction should feel guided, not like a blank chat box
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show simple options first; advanced controls available on demand
- **Contextual awareness:** The UI should always make it clear what sermon or series is active
- **Theological confidence:** Outputs should be presented with appropriate qualifiers and sources where applicable

### 6.2 Key UI States
- **Empty state** — When no sermon is active, display a welcoming onboarding flow with a "Start New Sermon" CTA and quick-start templates
- **Loading state** — When the agent is researching, show a progress indicator with descriptive steps (e.g., "Studying Greek root word...", "Comparing commentaries...") rather than a generic spinner
- **Error state** — When AI generation fails or hits a rate limit, display a clear message with actionable recovery steps (retry, simplify request, or contact support)
- **Success state** — When a draft is complete or approved, show a brief confirmation and prompt for the next logical action (e.g., "Sermon saved. Generate social posts?")

### 6.3 Open Design Questions
- Should the approval gates use a modal/interstitial pattern or an inline sidebar thread?
- What visual language best communicates "AI-generated but pastor-approved" to prevent congregation confusion?
- How should theological guardrails (denominational preferences) be configured — during onboarding, per workspace, or per sermon?

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Architecture Notes
- **Electron (main + renderer):** Provides the desktop shell with native file system access, secure secret storage, and auto-update capabilities. The renderer process runs a React SPA.
- **React (latest version):** Powers the UI layer with a component-based architecture. State management is handled via React Context and hooks for local UI state, with Convex queries for server state.
- **Convex:** Serves as the reactive backend and database. It manages user data, sermon content, agent workflow state, and credit balances. Convex "Durable Workflows" or scheduled functions handle long-running agent tasks.
- **OpenRouter Agent SDK:** Orchestrates the ReAct loop, tool calling, and human-in-the-loop pauses. It runs within the Electron main process or a secure backend context to protect API keys.
- **IndexedDB (via a library like Dexie.js):** Caches sermon drafts, workspace state, and user preferences for local-first functionality.
- **OpenRouter Gateway:** Routes AI requests to top-tier models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with web search and other tool capabilities.

### 7.2 Data Model

| Entity | Key Fields | Relationships |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **User** | id, email, name, creditBalance, createdAt | has many Sermons, has many CreditTransactions |
| **Sermon** | id, userId, title, scriptureRef, status (draft/approved), content, seriesId, createdAt, updatedAt | belongs to User, belongs to Series, has many Communications, has many SocialPosts |
| **Series** | id, userId, title, description, startDate, endDate | belongs to User, has many Sermons |
| **AgentWorkflow** | id, userId, sermonId, workspaceType, status (running/paused/completed), checkpointData, createdAt | belongs to User, belongs to Sermon |
| **Communication** | id, sermonId, type (email/announcement/letter), content, tone, status | belongs to Sermon |
| **SocialPost** | id, sermonId, platform, content, scheduledDate, status | belongs to Sermon |
| **CreditTransaction** | id, userId, amount, type (purchase/usage), description, createdAt | belongs to User |
| **TheologicalGuardrail** | id, userId, denomination, stylePrefs, customRules | belongs to User |

### 7.3 APIs & Integrations
- **OpenRouter API:** LLM inference with tool use, web search, and model routing
- **Convex API:** Database queries, mutations, reactive subscriptions, and workflow scheduling
- **Stripe API:** Credit purchases, payment intents, and billing webhooks
- **Electron Auto-Updater:** Silent updates with user notification
- **Future:** Bible API (ESV, NIV, etc.), Church Management Software APIs, Social Media publishing APIs

### 7.4 Technical Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OpenRouter API rate limits or downtime | Medium | High | Implement request queuing, fallback to secondary models, and clear user-facing status messages |
| Convex workflow timeouts on long agent tasks | Medium | High | Break agent loops into discrete steps using Convex scheduled functions; store checkpoint data after each step |
| Credit billing race conditions | Low | High | Use Convex transactions for atomic credit deduction; implement idempotency keys for Stripe webhooks |
| Offline sync conflicts (same doc edited on two devices) | Low | Medium | Use last-write-wins for MVP; plan operational transform or CRDT for future multi-device support |
| Electron security vulnerabilities | Medium | High | Keep Electron updated, use contextIsolation, secure secret storage in main process, Content Security Policy |
| AI generating theologically inaccurate content | Medium | High | Implement theological guardrails (user-configured), require human approval at key gates, display confidence/sourcing indicators |

## 11. Appendix

### Glossary
- **ReAct Loop:** A reasoning and acting pattern where an AI model thinks through a problem, takes an action (e.g., calls a tool), observes the result, and repeats until the task is complete.
- **Agentic Workflow:** A semi-autonomous process where an AI performs tasks, makes decisions, and pauses for human approval at defined checkpoints.
- **Skill (Tool):** A specialized function the AI can invoke, such as performing a Greek word study or generating a social media caption.
- **Approval Gate:** A deliberate pause in an AI workflow where the system presents options or partial results to the user and waits for direction before continuing.
- **Local-First:** An architecture where data is primarily stored locally on the user's device, with synchronization to a cloud backend when connectivity is available.
- **Convex Durable Workflow:** A long-running, fault-tolerant process in Convex that can survive app restarts and network interruptions.
